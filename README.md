# turtlefy
A collection of Shopify utilities to make life easier. 


Sometimes you just want to get things done in a straightforward
And lightweight manner.

Like pulling all your Shopify orders into a list so you 
Can do stuff with them.

Instead of reading all the API docs on how to paginate your
orders, or customers, products etc, just use the recursive 
function and boom, you got your list. Now do stuff.
